            <div class="intro"><h6>Perfection is proven.</h6></div>
            <div class="text"><p>What causes humans to be appealing to Gods? Their false display of perfection. 
                In their history, many authority figures claimed to be like the divine, dissolving their fragile world into ash left behind by conflict. 
                To believe that humans could ever accomplish such a feat is amusing. If only I, Umbra, could lay waste to my godly counterparts and shift humanityâ€™s hourglass into my favor. 
                I shall present to them what it means to be a perfect being and then reset humanity.</p></div>

    <div class="quote"><h4>He sits with these creatures and dines with them, like a pig drowning in manure and roundworms. 
        What stops me from accomplishing my goals? These infernal chains, shackling my dark form with the pain of a thousand suns, 
        but it serves as a reminder of my destiny and humanity's destiny. Blinded by this hatred, how could my current purpose be anything, but... dark? 
        Through my purpose, I am called to war to prevent humans from robbing us of our nobility. I may be damned, yet these humans intentionally crawl into their eternal inferno.</h4>
