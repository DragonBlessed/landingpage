My landing page project for The Odin Project. I hope to have demonstrated my skills in HTML and CSS.
The project was initially supposed to be a landing page for something the Odin Project course structure envisioned. Still, I decided to deviate from that and cater to my other hobby, plot/character creation. Now it is a landing page for an "upcoming" novel.
